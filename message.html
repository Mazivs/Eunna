      <h2>My Girl - Eunice ‚ù§Ô∏èüíç</h2>
      <p> Baby, I know this wont be exiting much but,I wanna do this genuinely for you‚ù§
        ....im pretty sure I would have made this already if you texted the paragraph...i would have gotten a lil excited about today and do this.I had zero motivation as I woke up..
        I just wished you a normal one..because of how i felt..dissapointed in myself and all.It was at such a day that I first set my eyes on you in 2023ü•∫
        ..I was really elated ammused and shoked at the same time..It was like I was staring at an Angel from Heaven..your pretty eyes..your lovely smile..your well done hair..beautiful skin
        ..soft lips ..your cute voice..Everything was perfect that dayü•∞üòç...and truthfully...I wanna remake that day each 29th Aril each year..unfortunately today was a bad timing..for both of us
        ...this day is forever marked in my heart and i know you cherish it more.I understand what you expect and expecting from me..and I'm  sorry for dissapointing you yet again..
        I wont make any more promises rather just suprise you as we go on...I appreciate the tolerance,the love and care you have for me..as I am right now.I wanna spend every second with you,
        and it pains me to see you dissapointed by me,that is not the picture I wanna keep.I will change  for you and I know with time  things will be better and you will have all you ever need from me.I love you so so much
        ...that I can't stand hurting you anymore...Im obsessed with you in all ways
        ..And I want you all to my self For life.We are gonna make a good family and the best parents‚ô•.I wanna appreciate you for always motivating me,believing in me and keeping me going.You are really the best thing that has ever happened to meüíç‚ù£.
        May God see us through..and May He keep blessing flowing our way my love.#TOGETHER4LIFE
    
      </p>
      <p>Happy Anniversary!</p>
